This application provides an interface between locast.org and Media Servers like [Plex Media Server (PMS)](https://plex.tv) and [Emby](https://emby.media) by acting like an [HDHomerun](https://www.silicondust.com/) or an m3u tuner and an XMLTV provider.

`locast2tuner` can imitate one or more digital tuners and provides geo cloaking across regions.

> ❗ Since locast.org uses Amazon Cloudfront to stream, region restrictions imposed by Cloudfront can not be circumvented. This means that `locast2tuner` might not work outside of the United States.
# Features
- Override your location using ZIP code or GPS coordinates
- Multiple digital tuners in a single server, either as separate servers or as one (multiplexing)
- Acts like either an HDHomerun or an m3u tuner
- Provides locast.org EPG information as an XMLTV guide
