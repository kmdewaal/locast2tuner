# 0.3.11
This release adds some better logging for login errors. In general error handling and reporting needs to be much better, but this is at least something.

Thanks to all the wonderful sponsors that donated since the last release! Since I added sponsoring to my account last week, I've received $260!
Once Github pays out, I'll donate the money and give everybody an update on which organizations received donations. Thanks to all the people
who have donated so far, because all of the money donated will go towards organizations that support women and underprivileged children in STEM education.
