# Windows

Currently a Microsoft Windows x64 binaries are available in [Github releases](https://github.com/wouterdebie/locast2tuner/releases/latest). Note that those binaries are just executables without any form of configuration. Work is ongoing to provide a proper installation package (MSI) that allows installing `locast2tuner` as a service.
