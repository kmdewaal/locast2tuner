# Logging
`locast2tuner` has a few options for logging: directly to the terminal (default), logging to a file and logging through syslog. You can combine the way you want to log by specifying multiple options:

- `quiet`: disable logging to the terminal
- `syslog`: log through syslog
- `logfile <filename>`: log to a file separately
